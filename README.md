# Ubuntu-guides
- This is a collection of guides for doing all sorts of stuff in Ubuntu.
- It is created primarilay as a way for me to minimize time spent doing something i have done before, and to document my jouney in the Linux-verse.
- You are free to use these guides for any purposes.
  - I do not promise these guides will work as there might be mistakes and they will become outdated.
